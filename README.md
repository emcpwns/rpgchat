# [RPG-Chat](http://ethanc.ga/rpgchat/)
RPG-Chat is a chat room in which users are given a role/character and have to roleplay based on their character and the basic story-line provided. Idea by [/u/Jethropolis](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideas/comments/2ywnj1/roleplaying_chatroom_idea/ "Original Reddit Post").
  
> *Since this is a 100% client-sided web-based project, the master branch and gh-pages branch are identicle*

## About

I created RPG-Chat with the intent to practice non-static web design. In the past I've created many static websites, and have even won web design competetions. 
However my knowledge on dynamic web languages was very limited. I had a small amount of knowledge about PHP from using it to optimize my static sites (using includes 
for menus, footers, etc.), but that was the extent of what I knew. 

I wound up going with a mostly JavaScript approach to RPG-Chat since it's client sided and already I had more exposure to it then I realized due to my work with 
front-end web frameworks. Overall RPG-Chat is primarily learning experience for me, but hopefully it's one that will bring others entertainment.
