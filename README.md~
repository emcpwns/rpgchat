# RPG-Chat
RPG-Chat is a chat room in which users are given a role/character and have to roleplay based on their character and the basic story-line provided. Idea by [/u/Jethropolis](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideas/comments/2ywnj1/roleplaying_chatroom_idea/ "Original Reddit Post").

## Coming soon:

* CSS Styling
* Chat function (duh)
* More in depth scenario
* More races
* (Probably) Random events
* (Maybe) More fantasy-styled name generation
* (Maybe) Gender selection
* (Maybe) Option to save scenario in cookies
* (Maybe) Option to select themed scenario ex: Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic, etc.
